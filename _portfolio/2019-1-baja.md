title: "BAJA SAE - Frame design leader (2016-2019)"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/portofolio/BAJA.jpg' width='600'><br/>
As part of a collegiate engineering competition, students were challenged to design and build a
single-seat, all-terrain vehicle capable of withstanding the extreme demands of off-road
environments. The project required the development of a complete vehicle system. In here, I worked
on the design of the Chassis. The project needed to meet critical design constraints, such as a
chassis weight under 70 lb and ergonomic accommodation for users from the 5th percentile female to
the 95th percentile male. An iterative finite element analysis (FEA) workflow was developed in
Siemens NX to validate structural designs, incorporating concentrated mass models of the driver and
drivetrain components to accurately simulate real-world loads. To validate the used model,
calibration experiments were conducted using strain gauges on key frame members, with measured
stress values compared against FEA predictions."
