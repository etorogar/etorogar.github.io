title: "Senior design - LUVOIR (2019)"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/portofolio/Senior.gif' width='600'><br/><br/>
The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) is a proposed NASA mission concept for a
next-generation, multi-wavelength space telescope designed to succeed the James Webb Space
Telescope. Two primary architectures are under consideration: one with a 15-meter aperture and
another with an 8-meter aperture. Given the stringent constraints on size and mass for space
deployment, this project—sponsored and mentored by a member of L3Harris—aimed to develop a
deployable architecture that minimizes stowed volume and overall system weight. The design focused
on accommodating both static and dynamic loading conditions during folding and deployment in space.
Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was performed using Siemens NX to evaluate structural performance and
validate design feasibility."
