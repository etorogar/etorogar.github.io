**Description**

The brain is enveloped in a cushion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which has been shown to play
unexpected roles in neurodegeneration and sleep. Through in vivo imaging, we found that after a
stroke, abnormal volumes of CSF rush through the brain, causing swelling.

**Contributions**

In this paper, I conducted data analysis of the in vivo measurements of CSF. Additionally, I
developed robust image analysis that could measure the dynamic changes of the artery width
following a stroke, even with high motion data.
