**Description**

Oedema, or swelling caused by fluid accumulation in the brain tissues, is investigated following
cardiac arrest. The study finds that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which plays a role in cleaning
metabolic products from the brain, is the primary source of brain oedema in cases of oxygen
deprivation.

**Contributions**

In this paper, I conducted data analysis of the in vivo measurements of CSF. Additionally, I
developed an algorithm to perform phase averaging of data, thus enhancing for particle tracking
velocimetry.
