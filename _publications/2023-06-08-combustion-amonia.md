**Description**

Ammonia offers a carbon-free fuel alternative. However, its low flame speed presents a significant
challenge for combustor stability. The study investigated the use of porous media burners to
stabilize Ammonia/hydrogen/air flames.

**Contributions**

I contributed to the experimental campaign by setting up the apparatus and taking measurements.
