**Description**

Ammonia (NH3) is an attractive fuel alternative for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the
slow flame speed, low heating value, and emissions of nitrogen-containing pollutants present
significant issues for practical combustion applications. To address these issues, we investigate
the use of matrix-stabilized combustion. 

**Contributions**

I contributed to the experimental campaign by setting up the apparatus and taking measurements.
