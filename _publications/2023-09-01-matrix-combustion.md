**Description**

Volume-averaged simulations are used to predict the Porous media combustion of an
ammonia/hydrogen/air mix. In this work, the modeling framework uses first-principles methods to
determine effective properties. This framework relies on adequately characterizing the topology of
the solid matrix, using commonly available X-ray computed microtomography.

**Contributions**

I performed and analyzed the X-ray computed microtomography in the porous media burners, and
performed the data analysis to obtain the characteristics of the foams such as porosity, cell size,
pore diameter, etc.. I contributed to the experimental campaign by setting up the apparatus and
taking measurements.
