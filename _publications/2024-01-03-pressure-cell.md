**Description**

We present a pressure cell designed for compatibility with a wide range of supercritical fluids
(SCFs), featuring integrated optical access for x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) and
X-ray pump–X–ray probe (XPXP) experiments. The paper highlights key considerations in the pressure
cell design, with a particular emphasis on optimization for XPCS applications.

**Contributions**

I led the design of the pressure cell featured in the study. Conducted performance testing to
verify reliability and compatibility with SCFs. Collaborated closely with machinists to ensure the
fabrication met the precise tolerances required for containing supercritical fluids.
